# API

Application Programming Interface.

It defines a set of definitions and protocolos that allows different softwares to communicate with each other and access their features.
In a backend webdevelopment context, it is usually composed of a set of endpoints (URLs) that can be accessed using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to access data or perform actions.

The way an API is structured can be different and there are a few popular ways to structure an API, such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.

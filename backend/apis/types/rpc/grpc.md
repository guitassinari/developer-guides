# gRPC

RPC is a way for programs (client) to run a function on another computer in the network (server) as if the function was being executed locally.

gRPC is an RPC framework developed by Google and now open-source and owned by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It provides tools for calling remote methods on a server as if they were local method using HTTP/2 and the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the serialization format (Interface Definition Language - IDL).

It has built-in features like load balancing, authentication, streaming (both ways), tracingm, health checks and automatic code generation. Also, it is language agnostic.
